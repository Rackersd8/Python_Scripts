Speed_Calc.py is a python script that will calculate your approximate download speed related to your current internet connection speeds. Use any type of internet speed test service such as cloudflare or ookla. Take the speed results you get and enter the results into the calc. You should receive an output of what your actual download speeds will be. An example would be if you have a 1GB internet connection according to your initial test, your calculated speed would be roughly 125 mb/s.
